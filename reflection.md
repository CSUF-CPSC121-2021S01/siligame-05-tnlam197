# Milestone 2

## Description
I applied std::unique_ptr for any game element, and tried to using all of them. I tried to fix the error code but have no idea what to do.

## Challenges encountered
There are some function that I have no idea how to deal with it such as Game::LaunchProjectiles() and Game::RemoveInactive(). The std::unique_ptr also confused that I dont know how to deal with the error

## Things I've learned
The most important things that I should learn in this milestone are how to use unique_ptr efficiency.
